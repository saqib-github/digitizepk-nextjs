                  <h3> 2020 Pandemic and Remote Development </h3>

                  <p>
                    The 2020 pandemic ushered within the way forward for work,
                    which lies within the remote. Putting an end to an age-old
                    debate about remote work flexibility, 2020 certainly made
                    remote work a norm. While employees shifted their
                    workstations to their homes, managers rushed into analyzing
                    situations and arising with new ways to make sure
                    productivity and keeping teams’ morale up in such times.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Challenges of remote working </h3>
                  <p>
                    With just a couple of days for 2020 to return to an end,
                    everyone knows that remote work isn't going anywhere. In
                    fact, studies and research have shown that remote working
                    will expand within the coming months.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So, managers, technical co-founders, and CTOs not just need
                    to fix for managing a good bigger remote workforce but also
                    understand the challenges of remote working and therefore
                    the tools which will help overcome them. along side that,
                    managing teams in 2021 would also mean being conscious of
                    the trends in remote work to manage better and retain
                    productivity despite things .

                  <h3>Top Challenges of Managing Remote IT Staff</h3>
                  <p>
                    If 2020 has taught us one thing, it's that the longer term
                    of labor is here. And it's remote. The revolution ushered in
                    by the pandemic is here to remain , but it didn't come very
                    easy for the worldwide workforce, especially the IT
                    industry. While security and transparency were a top
                    concern, there was a substantial challenge in managing this
                    remote IT staff.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Collaboration</h3>
                  <p>
                    One of the most important challenges comes once they need to
                    collaborate with their IT staff. they have to be in sync
                    with the event and make a proactive environment where the IT
                    teams can show-off their capabilities to the utmost.
                    However, being in several physical locations, collaborating
                    on projects becomes quite challenge. and particularly once
                    you are hiring remote developers, getting them to sync
                    together with your way of collaborating can take up a while.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Pro Tip:</h3>
                  <p>
                    Have a document ready with all the tools, tips, tricks, and
                    how-tos of collaboration. Hold an individual responsible of
                    coaching everyone on using the collaboration tools
                    effectively. Be it Basecamp, Jira, Trello, or the other ,
                    hold training sessions to assist your remote workers
                    familiarize themselves with the tools.
                  </p>
                  <div className="article-image">
                    <img
                      // height="400px"
                      width="100%"
                      src="/images/blog-details/panadamic-2.jpg"
                      alt="Image"
                    />
                  </div>
                  <h3>Other Challenges </h3>
                  <p>
                    Another challenge comes once they need to build a
                    corporation culture. Culture is imperative to enhance your
                    company’s brand image. But once you aren't in physical
                    proximity, fostering a culture becomes challenging. once
                    they aren't in physical proximity, many things get omitted ,
                    like - office banters, coffee discussions, on-desk chats,
                    group brainstorming, etc.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    All of this will not just cause weaker company culture but
                    also demotivate the solidarity that was earlier there when
                    things were normal. No human contact can even mean reduced
                    trust, which can hamper the standard of labor delivered by
                    the remote team.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Pro Tip:</h3>
                  <p>
                    Having an off-the-cuff channel on chat apps might be an
                    excellent thanks to start . Host some casual sessions and
                    are available up with new rewarding games to urge maximum
                    participation.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Working from home</h3>
                  <p>
                    Working from home, everyone has got to juggle between
                    different commitments. It can't be an equivalent as an
                    office where you'll send across a message or announce a
                    gathering instantly. People might be faraway from their
                    workstations or could be managing their tasks as per their
                    flexibilities.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Managing group meetings is sort of a challenge in remote
                    environments. It isn’t easy for everybody to be together at
                    an equivalent time. Some may need client commitments, breaks
                    at that point , or another family work. Not being within the
                    same office means the lack to call a moment meeting with
                    beat the office.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Suggestion :</h3>
                  <p>
                    While there are often nobody rule that applies to all or any
                    teams, it's essential to figure out with the team members
                    beforehand to return to a standard ground about this. Prior
                    management and scheduling of meets are often a method to
                    urge it done.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Challenges</h3>
                  <p>
                    Another challenge for many project managers managing remote
                    development teams is tracking productivity. Although most
                    employees might feel easier working remotely from the
                    comfort of homes or other places, it does accompany the
                    challenge of focusing
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Hence, the one thing that's most affected during remote
                    working is productivity. And for managers, keeping the
                    productivity intact may come as a challenge. they could not
                    associate their homes or other places as an area of labor ,
                    and even the slightest distraction from a loved one ,
                    neighbourhood noise, etc., may easily break their focus.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Way out :</h3>
                  <p>
                    You'll found out the proper goals for every day or week.
                    Convey that the work standard is unchanged regardless of
                    what the situation . Get daily check-ins and reporting at
                    the top of the day. Get trackers installed on the systems to
                    stay track of the work and allow them to know that somebody
                    is monitoring their work.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Benefits of Remote Work </h3>
                  <p>
                    While most of the people feel that remote working has
                    improved work-life balance, there are many that feel the
                    other . Even seasoned WFH pros are feeling the strain of
                    remote working during the pandemic.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The new remote workers could be feeling it too. Many don’t
                    have the specified workstation reception while others feel
                    that any routine has blurred in performing from home.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There also are many reports that employees are more
                    reluctant to require leaves during WFH. Many are even
                    stating that their working hours have increased due to
                    remote working and that they find themselves working extra
                    hours even after the official hours have closed.

                    working environment. And once you are managing a foreign
                    team, keeping a track of those trends is imperative. they

                    Let’s have a glance at the remote working trends.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Challenge of Productivity</h3>
                  <p>
                    While most of the people feel that productivity may be a
                    challenge in remote working, the reality is that managers
                    can relax as remote work flexibility is predicted to extend
                    employee productivity within the coming year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Owl Lab, a video conferencing company has released a report
                    suggesting the workers are working an additional 26 hours a
                    month in remote working situations. These might be the
                    commute hours that they're fixing extra. Moreover, when
                    offered flexibility, employees are encouraged to figure
                    harder and provides better results. Stanford research has
                    even concluded that remote employees are the maximum amount
                    as 13% more productive than their on-site workers.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Coved-19 Pandemic</h3>
                  <p>
                    The Covid pandemic led to a lockdown in most countries,
                    forcing the bulk of the workers to figure from home. most of
                    the people believe that everybody would revisit to normal
                    work once a vaccine is discovered.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, working remotely highlighted the various benefits
                    that one can enjoy with the added flexibility. there have
                    been already predictions within the Future Workforce Report
                    by Upwork that over 73% of all the departments would have
                    remote workers by 2028. This number is certainly increasing
                    in 2021 whether covid still exists or not.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Work from home and tools</h3>
                  <p>
                    Up until March 2020, the bulk of the remote workforce
                    consisted of these down within the corporate hierarchy.
                    However, as everyone started performing from home, even
                    those above within the corporate ladder just like the
                    managers, executives, CEOs, et al. have started working
                    remotely.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And this trend will still get stronger in 2021. So managers
                    also can expect to start out working remotely and managing
                    their remote or onsite teams from anywhere using the amazing
                    tools available now.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Sudden Boom in 2020 in remote Working</h3>
                  <p>
                    As remote work saw a sudden boom in 2020, the most
                    consideration for many businesses managing remote teams was
                    to make sure security.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Cyberattacks became common and businesses got to be
                    extremely careful within the security of their remote
                    workers’ network and VPNs. With the continual increase in
                    remote working, managers would need to prioritize new
                    strategies to manage risks and therefore the threats related
                    to it.

                  <h3>Benefits of Remote work</h3>
                  <p>
                    Remote work has always been synonymous for many to
                    performing from home. However, in 2021, they might not just
                    be performing from home. subsequent biggest trend in remote
                    working in 2021 would be performing from anywhere. Most
                    businesses would offer greater flexibility to their
                    workforce by allowing work from anywhere rather than just
                    home.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For managers, it might mean that they might got to keep a
                    track of the situation from which the workers are working.
                    whether or not they seek to figure from home, co-working
                    spaces, or from the other a part of the planet , they might
                    be ready to enjoy the pliability to try to so.
                  </p>
