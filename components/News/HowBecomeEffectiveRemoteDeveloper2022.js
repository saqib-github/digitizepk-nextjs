                    but due to the lack of physical interaction with other
                    members of your team, it could become hard for you to urge
                    the support a traditional team structure naturally gets.

                    Being around other developers is a method of learning new
                    things, but how does one continue to improve when you’re not
                    physically surrounded by a team you can easily bounce ideas
                    off?

                  <p>
                    Working remotely doesn't mean you’ve “made it”. It also
                    doesn’t mean that simply because you don’t have someone
                    supervising your every move, you're free to slack off as you
                    wish. although you work by yourself, you ought to strive to
                    be the best developer you can be. A hard-working attitude
                    will make your remote employer see that you simply have the
                    skills and mindset to do the job. Thus, they're going to be
                    more confident to invest in you.
                  </p>
                  <h4>Brainstorming </h4>
                  <p>
                    Mind the small print of your work even when there’s no one
                    closely breathing behind your neck. once you have to fix a
                    bug; don’t just solve the immediate issue. Instead, take a
                    step back first, then check out the bug’s origins: What
                    caused it? How long has the bug been there? How much does it
                    affect the project? Having an analytical approach will help
                    you gain priceless insights into a project’s foundations
                    even out of the more seemingly innocuous bugs.
                  </p>
                  <h4>Welcome Criticism key to success as remote developer </h4>
                  <p>

                    vital in your improvement as a professional. it'll help you
                    improve your programming skills as well as the way you
                    communicate issues with others. And once you open yourself
                    to the team’s criticism of your work, you’ll gain a
                    transparent insight as a Remote developer into the things
                    you do that other developers might find uncertain.
                  </p>
                  <h4>Encourage friendly environment </h4>
                  <p>
                    Encourage a friendly environment where constructive
                    criticism is welcomed As a Remote developer, be proactive in
                    receiving and giving feedback. And once you are providing
                    feedback, always remember: the goal is to challenge your
                    peers to be better at their jobs, and to not deliberately
                    offend them.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Interact on regular basis through video conferences</h3>
                  <p>
                    Remote teams should hold periodic sessions where everyone
                    shares their opinions, learnings,
                  </p>
                  <div className="article-image">

                  <p>
                    problems, and important findings about the project. the
                    thought is for everyone be aware of all of the points that
                    will be discussed during the feedback sessions a few days in
                    advance, in order that their opinion can be as real and
                    productive as possible.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Then, on the established date, find a spot where you'll be
                    visibly seen and clearly heard during the video conference
                    (which means a stable internet connection, too). apart from
                    verbally saying your message, communication is additionally
                    about body language, so ensuring that the
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    team can appreciate each other’s tone and body language
                    while holding the feedback session will help establish
                    better understanding.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Take management in Confidence</h3>
                  <p>
                    Take management in Confidence Be hospitable your remote
                    employer about your personal goals and interests within the
                    industry, whether or not they’re outside the scope of your
                    current role within the company. for instance , if they have
                    a JavaScript developer for their current website project,
                    you'll also mention that you are an Android developer and
                    that you can also help them build an app. Doing this may
                    make them think of you whenever an opportunity arises.

                  <p>
                    This doesn't only create more opportunities for you in the
                    future, but being open about your goals and interests could
                    strengthen the rapport you've got with your employer. they
                    might be more open to sharing some learning opportunities to
                    you as well, like letting you ask an in-house expert, or
                    sharing some learning resources they need for the company.
                    once you grow as a developer, you add value to yourself,
                    which successively makes you an even better asset to the
                    team as well.

                  <h3>Appreciate code reviews from peers </h3>
                  <p>
                    When you are working on a code base shared across other
                    developers, it’s important to determine guidelines which
                    dictate the project’s structure. And by establishing formal
                    code reviews, the team ensures everyone maintains top-notch
                    code quality while being mindful of the established
                    guidelines. Opening yourself to your peers’ criticism are
                    often considered an integral part of learning the
                    intricacies of programming.

                  <h3>When reviewing code:</h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Understand what problem the code trying to unravel .
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Make sure that the code provides a valid solution to the
                      problem.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Validate the team’s established guidelines. There are
                      countless ways of solving an issue , and any solution is
                      valid as long because it respects the project’s

                    <li>
                      Analyse if the code is straightforward to collaborate
                      with. A block of code that's easy to read is better than a
                      single line of technically confusing code.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If you think that there is a more favourable solution,
                      provide proof on why your solution is perfect . Then have
                      the team determine if your proposal should be used. a
                      symbol can be a clear explanation, a piece of writing , a
                      blog post from an authority, a piece in the technical
                      documentation, a unit test, or maybe a benchmark test
                      between solutions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      skip any ideas you have that do not relate to the original
                      problem. Code reviews aren't the place to share
                      improvements on things that are not related to the problem
                      at hand. Start another email thread or roll in the hay on
                      a different task.

                  </ul>

                      Be prepared to demonstrate why your solution is perfect .

                    <li>
                      Take into consideration everyone’s opinion and reply to

                    The only tool you need is to have a solid version control
                    system that provides an easy to use interface. GitHub is
                    that the most popular code hosting site online and it also
                    makes coding reviews more conversational.

                  <p>
                    A lot of developers will tell you that the best way to learn
                    programming is through pair programming and mentorship.
                    Which is sensible because having some form of established
                    partnership that can guide you throughout the development
                    process is better than having no one to rely on. Especially
                    if it’s an expert guiding you. and that we know that in
                    programming, many problems have already been solved by
                    experienced programmers and they have the right insights to
                    solve these problems.

                  <h4>Find a mentor for guidance</h4>
                  <p>
                    Find a mentor you trust, whether on your own personal
                    network or through platforms like Codementor, where you'll
                    have an expert look at your code or help you get unstuck if
                    you face difficult challenges.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These experts can facilitate your maximize your knowledge by
                    teaching you the solution to problems they may already have
                    encountered in the past. Of course, it’s always good to try
                    to research on your own, but once you’ve done your part,
                    seek validation to your conclusions by asking an expert for
                    help.

                  <p>
                    When a software application is formed , there are many
                    choices taken when picking the development stack that’s
                    right for the job. Over time, new tools begin that are,
                    perhaps, better than those already implemented. Every
                    company wants to be efficient but it isn’t very practical
                    for many companies, especially small businesses, to chase
                    after every new trend that comes out. Despite being tied to
                    a given technology, that doesn’t mean you can’t learn new
                    languages and tools on your own.

                  <h4>Social media Marketing </h4>
                  <p>
                    Social media and online communities are great ways to follow
                    industry leaders and keep track of your industry’s most
                    vital trends. These community-vetted leaders take the
                    guesswork out of deciding what you should pay attention to
                    next within your area of expertise. Here are some
